Dear Issa,

This project repository should be used to keep track on all the analysis we are doing for the JGI_rsequencing panel.

Here is how we should organize ourselves. We do need to follow these guidelines to make sure that we dont generate a mess:

Please keep all documentation of analyses here and organize them in a transparent way. That is, document all steps you did and make it up-to-date.

We will refer to this repository in Trello to keep track on the progress. Whenever you made a new analysis please indicate its location on trello
but keep all the neceseeary information in this repo(scripts etc...).
That is, we will use trello to record the steps and the progress but keep all necessary info here.
Finally, as space will not permit to upload large files to gitlab, we have to reference the location of those files here and on trello.

Lets use the following directory structure:

/DATA_cleaning
/SNP_calling
/Statitical_analysis

Issues/discussions:

To facilitate discussion, we should do this on gitlab using the issue tracker. I will now make a test and will see how well it will work.
